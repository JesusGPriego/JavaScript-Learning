# JavaScript-Learning

In this repository Ill be uloading what I learn about JS.

# Passenge-Counter:

This is a tiny app that increments the value of an element everytime a button is clicked. It also lets the user "save" a value, and shows the lasts registers.

To make this I've learnt:

- console logs
- basic var definitions
- Element acces by Id
- Element content manipulation
